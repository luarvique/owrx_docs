This document is about
<A HREF="https://luarvique.github.io/ppa/">OpenWebRX+</A>,
an improved and extended version of the original
<A HREF="https://www.openwebrx.de/">OpenWebRX</A>
web-based SDR radio. For casual radio listeners, it explains how to use 
online OpenWebRX+ receivers and what you can do with them. For those 
interested in hosting their own OpenWebRX+ receiver, there are 
installation instructions and advice for selecting the hardware.
</P>

<P>
OpenWebRX+ adds many features missing from the original OpenWebRX, such 
as noise reduction, tuning steps, scanner, keyboard shortcuts, improved 
user interface and maps, and decoders for many digital communication 
protocols. Please note that the following document covers <B>both</B> 
the original OpenWebRX and the extended OpenWebRX+. Features specific to 
OpenWebRX+ are marked so.

<A NAME="Docs"><H2>How to Use OpenWebRX+</H2></A>
<P>
Since OpenWebRX is a server designed to share SDR resources among 
multiple users, its operation is somewhat different from regular SDR 
applications. This section explains the basics of OpenWebRX usage, 
including the main display and controls.
</P>

<A NAME="HOW-DISPLAY"><H3>Main Display</H3></A>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="80%" STYLE="max-width:800px;" SRC="gfx/Display.png"></CENTER>
<OL>

<LI><P>
The <B>scrolling waterfall</B> shows the band activity in your currently 
selected SDR profile. The waterfall colors represent signal levels at 
each frequency, with brighter colors corresponding to stronger signals. 
Thus, a strong, healthy, ongoing signal will look like a bright vertical 
stripe at the waterfall. Different signal modulations produce 
differently shaped stripes. See
<A HREF="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Signal_Identification_Guide">Signal Identification Guide</A>
for examples.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <B>frequency scale</B> shows the actual frequencies, as well as the 
currently tuned frequency, represented with the yellow caret. This is 
the frequency you are currently <B>listening</B> to. The numbers at the 
caret sides stand for the current filter bounds. You can change these 
bounds by dragging the caret sides.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <B>spectrum display</B>, found in OpenWebRX+, shows the 
<B>current</B> signal level at each frequency, as opposed to the 
historic level shown by the waterfall. The spectrum display has a little 
bit of latency, to make sure that short signals still leave their mark 
on the spectrum.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <B>step-tuning buttons</B> let you tune up and down the frequency 
scale by left-clicking them. With the "side-stepping" feature enabled, 
you can also right-click these buttons to step outside your currently 
selected profile.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <B>bookmarks</B> let you quickly tune to previously bookmarked 
frequencies. There are three types of bookmarks in OpenWebRX:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Green</B> bookmarks represent frequencies defined by the band plan. 
These bookmarks are not editable, other than by modifying the band plan.
<LI>
<B>Yellow</B> bookmarks are saved on the OpenWebRX server and can be 
edited by the administrator.
<LI>
<B>Blue</B> bookmarks are saved in your web browser and can thus be 
created and edited by you.
</UL>
</P>

<LI><P>
The <B>receiver information</B> is shown by clicking the icon at the 
top-left page corner. This information is filled in by the 
administrator and includes receiver's name, location and the hardware 
description.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <SPAN CLASS="Button">Status</SPAN> button toggles the <B>status 
bar</B> shown at the bottom of the receiver web page.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <SPAN CLASS="Button">Chat</SPAN> button toggles the <B>log and chat 
panel</B> shown at the bottom of the receiver web page. If the 
administrator has chosen to disable chat functionality, this button will 
turn into <SPAN CLASS="Button">Log</SPAN>, opening the non-interactive 
log panel instead.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <SPAN CLASS="Button">Receiver</SPAN> button toggles the <B>main 
control panel</B> for the receiver.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <SPAN CLASS="Button">Map</SPAN> button opens the <B>map page</B> 
showing radio stations, repeaters, other online receivers, and position 
reports from various sources, such as airplanes, ships, and HAM 
operators.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <SPAN CLASS="Button">Files</SPAN> button opens the <B>file browser 
page</B> with the most recently received SSTV images, faxes, and other 
data.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <SPAN CLASS="Button">Settings</SPAN> button opens the password 
protected <B>settings page</B> for configuring OpenWebRX. Normally, only 
server administrator needs to access the server settings.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <B>status bar</B> at the bottom of receiver's page displays the 
current status of the server and its connection to your web browser. 
Various panels show network throughput, server CPU load and temperature, 
audio sampling rate, and so on.
</P>

</OL>

<A NAME="HOW-CONTROLS"><H3>Main Controls</H3></A>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="80%" STYLE="max-width:800px;" SRC="gfx/Controls.png"></CENTER>
<OL>

<LI><P>
This is the <B>currently tuned frequency</B> of the receiver. You can 
change it by clicking on the waterfall, the bookmarks, or by entering it 
directly into this field. <B>The frequency can only be changed within 
the current profile bounds.</B>
</P>

<LI><P>
Click this button to <B>bookmark</B> your current frequency. The new 
bookmark will be stored locally in your browser and appear as a blue 
marker above the waterfall.
</P>

<LI><P>
This is the <B>current profile</B>, including the SDR device name 
("RSPdx"). OpenWebRX supports multiple SDR devices with multiple 
profiles for each device. When selecting a new profile, remember that it 
will change for <B>all users of the same SDR device</B>, so be 
considerate when you see somebody else using the server.
</P>

<LI><P>
This is the list of all available <B>audio modulation modes</B>, with 
the current mode highlighted in yellow. Select a new mode by clicking 
corresponding button, but keep in mind that not all modes can be 
applicable. It helps to know what each modulation looks like on the 
waterfall. Consult the
<A HREF="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Signal_Identification_Guide">Signal Identification Guide</A>
if unsure.
</P>

<LI><P>
This button will light up if a <B>digital decoder is active</B>. Click 
it to toggle digital decoding off.
</P>

<LI><P>
This is the <B>current digital decoding mode</B>, if active. You can 
select a new digital decoding mode from the list here, but keep in mind 
that not all modes can be applicable. It helps to know what each digital 
mode looks like on the waterfall. Consult the
<A HREF="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Signal_Identification_Guide">Signal Identification Guide</A>
if unsure.
</P>

<LI><P>
Use this slider to control <B>audio volume</B>. Click the speaker button 
to mute or unmute audio.
</P>

<LI><P>
Use this slider to set the <B>squelch threshold</B>. Left-click the
<SPAN CLASS="Button">SQ</SPAN> button to toggle squelch on and off. When 
the squelch is on, any audio that is below the selected squelch 
threshold will be muted.
</P>
<P>
Right-clicking the <SPAN CLASS="Button">SQ</SPAN> button toggles the 
frequency scanner, making <SPAN CLASS="Button">SQ</SPAN> button glow 
green. The scanner will automatically check all bookmarked frequencies 
for signals that are above the squelch threshold and tune to them. Once 
a signal disappears, the scanner will continue checking bookmarks for 
more signals.
</P>

<LI><P>
Use this slider to set the <B>noise reduction threshold</B>. Click the
<SPAN CLASS="Button">NR</SPAN> button to toggle noise reduction on and 
off. The noise reduction algorithm works on the spectral subtraction 
principle. It will remove any frequencies that are below the selected 
threshold from the audio, reducing the background noise. Remember that 
excessive use of noise reduction may distort or muffle the useful sounds 
though.
</P>

<LI><P>
The <B>tuning step</B> selector lets you choose the frequency tuning 
granularity. For example, if 1kHz step is selected, the frequency will 
always tune in 1kHz increments. Different profiles may assume different 
default tuning steps, such as 5kHz for shortwave broadcasters or 500Hz 
for HAM operators using SSB modulation. Click the adjacent button to
reset tuning step to its default value for the current profile.
</P>

<LI><P>
This slider sets the signal level for the <B>"hottest" waterfall 
color</B> (usually red). Set it higher when looking at strong signals, 
lower when looking at weak signals.
</P>
<P>
Left-click the adjacent button to make a one-time automatic adjustment 
of the waterfall colors. Right-click the button to toggle continuous 
automatic adjustment of the waterfall colors.
</P>

<LI><P>
This slider sets the signal level for the <B>"coldest" waterfall 
color</B> (usually blue). Set it higher when looking at strong signals, 
lower when looking at weak signals.
</P>
<P>
Left-click the adjacent button to reset waterfall colors to their 
default values.
</P>

<LI><P>
This drop-down list lets you choose one of the <B>user interface 
themes</B>. Clicking the adjacent button resets user interface to the 
default theme.
</P>

<LI><P>
This slider controls the <B>user interface opacity</B>, making panels 
more or less visible on top of the waterfall. Click the adjacent button 
to reset user interface to the full opacity.
</P>

<LI><P>
The four zoom buttons let you <B>zoom waterfall</B> in and out. Zooming 
always happens around the currently tuned frequency, keeping it on 
display.
</P>

<LI><P>
The clock at the bottom of the main panel shows the <B>current Universal 
Coordinated Time (UTC)</B>. Most of the OpenWebRX user interface 
operates in UTC, so this clock is shown for easier reference.
</P>

<LI><P>
Click the <SPAN CLASS="Button">REC</SPAN> button to start <B>recording 
audio</B> at any moment. The button will glow red, indicating ongoing 
recording. Once you click the <SPAN CLASS="Button">REC</SPAN> button 
again, it will stop recording and save the recorded audio to a file.
</P>

<LI><P>
The bar at the bottom indicates the <B>current signal level</B>. It will 
change color based on what OpenWebRX considers signal overload. There is 
also a numeric readout, showing the exact value in decibels.
</P>

<LI><P>
This button toggles the <B>live spectrum display</B> above the 
waterfall. When using it, keep in mind that the spectrum display may 
make your web browser use a lot of processor power.
</P>

</OL>

<A NAME="HOW-MOUSE"><H3>Using Mouse and Touch</H3></A>
<P>
OpenWebRX requires the use of the right mouse button. <B>On devices with 
a single mouse button</B> (such as Apple computers), the right mouse 
button is simulated by holding the <SPAN CLASS="Button">CONTROL</SPAN> 
key with a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
<B>On touch-based devices</B>, such as smartphones and tablets, the 
right mouse button is simulated by holding the spot with your finger for 
a little bit longer than usual.
</P>
<P>
The <B>mouse scroll wheel</B> operates in two modes: <B>normal</B> and 
<B>modified</B> (with the right mouse button, the wheel button, or the 
<SPAN CLASS="Button">SHIFT</SPAN> key pressed):
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><B>In the waterfall:</B><BR>
Normal wheel spin tunes frequency, modified wheel spin changes zoom 
factor. This behavior can be reversed with a checkbox found in the 
receiver panel.
</P>
<LI><P><B>In the frequency scale:</B><BR>
Both normal and modified wheel spins tune frequency.
</P>
<LI><P><B>At the bandpass filter (yellow caret):</B><BR>
Normal wheel spin shifts filter left or right, modified wheel spin makes 
filter wider or narrower.
</P>
</UL>

<A NAME="HOW-KEYBOARD"><H3>Using Keyboard</H3></A>
<P>
OpenWebRX+ includes keyboard shortcuts for accessing the most common 
interface functions. To see the complete list of shortcuts, press the
<SPAN CLASS="Button">?</SPAN> key, which opens the following panel:
</P>

<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="80%" STYLE="max-width:800px;" SRC="gfx/Keys.png"></CENTER>

<A NAME="HOW-SCANNER"><H3>Frequency Scanner</H3></A>
<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_scanner"><I>What is a scanner?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
The OpenWebRX+ includes a frequency scanner that can monitor currently 
shown bookmarks for activity. When the scanner detects a signal at one 
of the bookmarked frequencies, it will tune to that frequency. Once that 
frequency goes quiet, the scanner goes back to monitoring all shown 
bookmarks. In order to use the scanner, do the following:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Choose a profile with some bookmarked frequencies you are interested in.
<LI><P>
Tune to an empty part of the waterfall and left-click the
<SPAN CLASS="Button">SQ</SPAN> button in order to set the squelch level.
</P>
<LI><P>
Right-click the <SPAN CLASS="Button">SQ</SPAN> button to start scanning.
The <SPAN CLASS="Button">SQ</SPAN> button will glow green indicating 
that the scanner is on. Mobile device users can simply hold the button
down for a longer time to simulate the right-click.
</P>
<LI><P>
Once done, right-click the <SPAN CLASS="Button">SQ</SPAN> button again
to disable the scanner.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
Please, keep in mind that <B>the scanner will not work on digital voice 
channels</B>, since they tend to keep signal on even if there is no

<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting"><I>What is FM broadcasting?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
The FM broadcasts generally occur between 76MHz and 108MHz. Each 
broadcaster is allocated 100kHz of spectrum, unless they are in the US 
where 200kHz is allocated to each station. FM broadcasts may reach 
distances up to 100km, limited by the horizon line. If you live in the 
US, the closest FM stations can be found via the
<A HREF="https://radio-locator.com/">Radio Locator</A>
website.
</P>
<P>
In order to listen to FM broadcasts in OpenWebRX, select a profile 
containing above frequencies, press the <SPAN CLASS="Button">WFM</SPAN> 
button at the receiver panel, and tune to one of the signals. Please 
note that OpenWebRX only plays <B>mono sound</B>, so there will not be 
any stereo.
</P>
<P>
OpenWebRX also allows to <B>decode textual RDS information</B> sent 
within FM broadcasts, such as station name, program name and type, and 
so on. If enabled, this information shows up in a box at the bottom of
the waterfall.
</P>
<P CLASS="Admin">
Since <B>RDS data is encoded slightly differently in the US</B>, 
compared to Europe, you may want to go to <I>"Settings | Demodulation 
and Decoding | Miscellaneous"</I> and change the <I>"Decode USA-specific 
RDS information from WFM broadcasts"</I> option to reflect your receiver 
location.
</P>

<A NAME="HOW-AM"><H3 CLASS="Section">Listening to AM Broadcasts</H3></A>
<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_broadcasting"><I>What is AM broadcasting?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
By "AM", people generally mean radio broadcasts occurring in the LW and 
MW bands, between 100kHz and 1800kHz. Each station is allocated 10kHz of 
the spectrum. During the day, AM broadcasts may reach up to 200km, but 
this distance greatly increases during the night. If you live in the US, 
the closest AM stations can be found via the
<A HREF="https://radio-locator.com/">Radio Locator</A>
website.
</P>
<P>
In order to listen to AM broadcasts in OpenWebRX, select a profile 
containing above frequencies, press the <SPAN CLASS="Button">AM</SPAN> 
button at the receiver panel, and tune to one of the signals. If the 
signal you are interested in is obscured by adjacent signals, try using 
the <SPAN CLASS="Button">SAM</SPAN> button instead. It has the same 
effect as <SPAN CLASS="Button">AM</SPAN>, but uses a different algorithm 
more resistant to interference.
</P>

<A NAME="HOW-SWL"><H3 CLASS="Section">Shortwave Listening (SWL)</H3></A>
<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_listening"><I>What is SWL?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
"Shortwave" describes
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_bands">multiple bands</A>
between 1800kHz and 30MHz used by radio broadcasters, amateurs, and 
professionals alike. The SWL activity generally refers to shortwave 
broadcast listening though, with broadcasters easily reaching across 
thousands of kilometers using AM modulation. Global shortwave broadcast 
schedules can be found at the
<A HREF="https://short-wave.info/">Shortwave Info</A> and
<A HREF="https://shortwaveschedule.com/">Shortwave Schedule</A>
websites.
</P>
<P>
In order to listen to shortwave broadcasts in OpenWebRX, select a 
profile containing the shortwave band you are interested in, press the 
<SPAN CLASS="Button">AM</SPAN> button at the receiver panel, and tune to 
one of the signals. If the signal is obscured by adjacent signals, try 
using the <SPAN CLASS="Button">SAM</SPAN> button instead. It has the 
same effect as <SPAN CLASS="Button">AM</SPAN>, but uses a different 
algorithm more resistant to interference.
</P>
<P>
Some shortwave broadcasters have started to use
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Radio_Mondiale">Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM)</A>
for their broadcasts. If you see a clearly digital signal at a shortwave 
band, try tuning to it, pressing the <SPAN CLASS="Button">DRM</SPAN> 
button, and waiting 30-40 seconds for the decoder to sync. DRM 
broadcasts are somewhat rare at the moment though.
</P>
<P>
Once a day, OpenWebRX+ queries the
<A HREF="http://www.eibispace.de/">EiBi</A>

<A NAME="HOW-HDR"><H3 CLASS="Section">HDRadio: Digital FM in America</H3></A>
<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_Radio"><I>What is HDRadio?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
Many American FM broadcasters are now using a form of digital radio 
known as <I>HDRadio</I> or <I>NRSC5</I>. The HDRadio signal, showing up 
as two thick "columns" around a traditional WFM signal, adds up to four 
digital channels to each analog FM broadcast.
</P>
<P>
<B>HDRadio decoding requires a lot of CPU power and will not work on 
slower computers, or wide profiles.</B> In order to listen to HDRadio in 
OpenWebRX+, tune to an "enhanced" WFM signal and click on the <SPAN 
CLASS="Button">HDR</SPAN> button. Once the decoder syncs with the 
signal, the station information and the channel selector should show up 
at the bottom of the waterfall.

<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting"><I>What is DAB?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
Where American broadcasters use HDRadio, European FM broadcasters use a 
different digital standard known as <I>DAB</I>. Each DAB multiplex 
signal essentially occupies a single old analog TV channel and transmits 
many individual radio station signals at once.
</P>
<P>
<B>DAB decoding requires a lot of CPU power and will not work on slower 
computers, or wide profiles.</B> In order to listen to DAB in OpenWebRX,

This section discusses amateur (HAM) radio uses and how to use OpenWebRX 
to listen to the amateur radio.
</P>

<A NAME="HOW-CB"><H3 CLASS="Section">Listening to Citizens Band (CB)</H3></A>
<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio"><I>What is CB?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
Citizens Band (CB) generally covers a swath of spectrum between 27MHz 
and 28MHz, where individuals can communicate without a license, as long 
as they adhere to a few rules. The exact boundaries of the CB band 
differ from country to country. It sits adjacent to the 10m amateur 
band.
</P>
<P>
In most places, the CB band is divided into 40 channels (CB1 to CB40), 
spaced at 10kHz. OpenWebRX+ provides default bookmarks for these 
channels. While all analog voice modes (AM, FM, LSB, USB) were 
originally allowed on CB, the US users generally prefer AM at lower 
channels and LSB at upper channels. In the UK, where AM has been
banned until recently, FM is the most common CB mode.
</P>
<P>
In order to listen to CB in OpenWebRX, select a profile containing the 
CB band and tune to one of the signals by clicking on the waterfall or 
a bookmark. You may then have to press
<SPAN CLASS="Button">AM</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="Button">FM</SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS="Button">LSB</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="Button">USB</SPAN>
button at the receiver panel, depending on the modulation type used by 
the transmission you are listening to.
</P>

<A NAME="HOW-HAM"><H3 CLASS="Section">Listening to HAM Bands</H3></A>
<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_operator"><I>What is HAM?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
The amateur radio operators (HAMs) are found at 160m, 80m, 40m, 20m, and 
a few
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_bands">other shortwave bands</A>.
All kinds of activities happen at these bands, from Morse code, to 
voice, to digital communications.
</P>
<P>
Each amateur band is usually broken into three parts:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The bottom part is used for the Morse code transmissions, also 
known as "telegraph" or CW.
<LI><P>
Right above the Morse code, there is a bunch of digital transmissions in 
different modes, such as RTTY, FT8, FT4, and so on. A lot of these modes 
operate at fixed frequencies, which are included into OpenWebRX band 
plan and thus show up as green bookmarks.
</P>
<LI><P>
The rest of a band is allocated for the voice (or "telephone") 
transmissions using LSB or USB modulation, with some AM sprinkled in. 
The LSB modulation is used below 20m, while USB is used at 20m and 
above.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
In order to listen to amateur radio operators in OpenWebRX, select a 
profile containing the HAM band you are interested in, press the
<SPAN CLASS="Button">LSB</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="Button">USB</SPAN>
button at the receiver panel and tune to one of the signals. While most 
amateur transmissions occur at 1kHz boundaries, you may have to tune 
more precisely to get cleaner sound.
</P>

<A NAME="HOW-CW"><H3 CLASS="Section">Listening to Morse Code (CW)</H3></A>
<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave"><I>What is CW?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
Most Morse code (CW) transmissions occur at the lower end of amateur 
radio bands, such as 3500-3600kHz, 7000-7100kHz, 14000-14100kHz, and 
so on. To engage the CW mode in OpenWebRX, press the
<SPAN CLASS="Button">CW</SPAN> button at the receiver panel. In this 
mode, the bandpass filter shrinks to 700-900Hz range for better 
selectivity. Also, when in CW mode, OpenWebRX+ will tune <B>800Hz 
below</B> clicked carrier frequency, to make sure that the carrier is 
always heard.
</P>
<P>
For those who do not understand Morse code, OpenWebRX+ offers 
<B>automated CW decoding</B>, enabled by selecting the <I>"CW 
Decoder"</I> digital mode. The CW decoder presents you with a zoomed 
secondary waterfall that may contain multiple CW signals. Once you click 
on a CW signal you are interested in, the decoded text will show up 
below the secondary waterfall, with unrecognized characters shown as
underscores.
</P>
<P CLASS="Admin">
You can also make the CW decoder <B>show the original dits and dahs</B> 
it is decoding. To do that, go to <I>"Settings | Demodulation and 
Decoding | Miscellaneous"</I> and enable the <I>"Show CW codes (dits / 
dahs) when decoding CW"</I> option.
</P>
<P>
Finally, OpenWebRX+ can attempt <B>decoding all CW transmissions in 
24kHz of spectrum</B>, at once, in real time, and present them to you in 
a table, sorted by frequency. This functionality is enabled by selecting 
the
<I>"CW Skimmer"</I> digital mode.
</P>
<P CLASS="Admin">
CW skimmer support requires installing the
<A HREF="https://github.com/luarvique/csdr-cwskimmer">CSDR CWSkimmer</A>

<A NAME="HOW-RTTY"><H3 CLASS="Section">Receiving Teletype (RTTY)</H3></A>
<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTTY"><I>What is RTTY?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
A teletype transmission consists of two carrier signals, where one 
signal designates "spaces" (or zeros), while the other signal designates 
"marks" (or ones). Five bits in a row make a character, encoded with 
Baudot code. Hence, there are three important parameters describing 
an RTTY transmission:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><B>Bandwidth (Hz)</B><BR>
This is the distance, in hertz, between two carrier signals. Common 
bandwidths are 85Hz, 170Hz, 450Hz, and 650Hz.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Bitrate (baud)</B><BR>
This is the transmission speed, determining how many bits per second are 
being sent. Common bitrates are 45bd, 45.45bd, 50bd, 75bd, and 100bd.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Reverse</B><BR>
The "reverse" option, when applied, flips the meanings of "space" and 
"mark" frequencies.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
OpenWebRX+ comes with three different RTTY settings, selected via 
digital mode drop-down list:
</P> 
<UL>
<LI><P><B>RTTY-170 (45)</B><BR>
This is the mode commonly used by HAM operators, with 170Hz bandwidth 
and 45bd bitrate. You can find transmissions in this mode just above 
Morse code transmissions on most HAM HF bands.
</P>
<LI><P><B>RTTY-450 (50N)</B><BR>
This mode is used by the German weather service, most often found at the 
10100kHz frequency. OpenWebRX+ includes default (yellow) bookmarks for 
this and other German weather RTTY frequencies. This mode uses 450Hz 
bandwidth and 50bd bitrate, with "mark" and "space" frequencies 
reversed.
</P>
<LI><P><B>RTTY-85 (50N)</B><BR>
This mode is often used at the LF and VLF bands, where available 
bandwidth is limited. It has 85Hz bandwidth and 50bd bitrate, with 
"mark" and "space" frequencies reversed.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
In order to receive a teletype transmission in OpenWebRX+, press the 
<SPAN CLASS="Button">USB</SPAN> button at the receiver panel and tune to 
an RTTY transmission, which looks like two signals close together. Then 
select one of the RTTY decoders described above. It will present you 
with a zoomed secondary waterfall that may contain multiple RTTY 
signals. Once you click on an RTTY signal you are interested in, the 
decoded text will show up below the secondary waterfall, with 
unrecognized characters shown as underscores.

<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band"><I>What is ISM?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
Many modern wireless devices, such as weather stations, security 
sensors, tire pressure sensors, car keys, etc., use radio frequencies to 
communicate. These devices are normally found in 433-435MHz, 902-928MHz, 
and some other bands. In order to monitor smart device transmissions in 
OpenWebRX+, do the following:
</P>
<OL>
<LI><P>
Look around ISM frequencies for signals that may be produced by wireless 
devices.
</P>
<LI><P>
Once you see any suspicious signals, tune near them and select the 
<I>"ISM"</I> digital mode. The ISM decoder will monitor and display a 
wide swath of spectrum around your tuned frequency.
</P>
<LI><P>
Wait until the signals reappear. If the ISM decoder is able to 
understand them, the decoded data will appear in a separate panel on top 
of the waterfall display.
</P>
</OL>
<P>
If you are unable to decode any ISM signals or do not see any on the 
waterfall, <B>try testing the decoder with your wireless car keys</B>. 
It is important to know their signalling frequency though.
</P>

<A NAME="Air"><H2>Aeronautic Communications</H2></A>
<P>
Most voice communications between pilots and air traffic controllers 
occur in the specially designated 108-137MHz VHF "air band". Somewhat 
unusual for VHF bands, aircraft use AM modulation to let multiple 
signals be heard at once at the same frequency. On the shortwave bands, 
you will find aeronautic weather reports (VOLMET) and some pilot chatter 
using USB modulation.
</P>
<P>
In addition to analog voice communications, aircraft and air traffic 
control services use several digital radio protocols for
<A HREF="#HOW-ADSB">location reporting</A>,
<A HREF="#HOW-VDL2">telemetry</A>,
<A HREF="#HOW-ACARS">messaging</A>, and 
<A HREF="#HOW-HFDL">traffic management</A>.
With sufficient hardware, OpenWebRX+ can receive multiple aeronautic 
protocols at multiple frequencies at once, maintaining a common database 
of all received aircraft data and presenting it on the map.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft are identified with several different IDs, including flight ID, 
aircraft tail number, and ICAO code (aka Mode-S transponder code). 
OpenWebRX+ will hyperlink received IDs to the
<A HREF="https://www.flightaware.com/">FlightAware</A>
website, where you can find flight paths, photos, and other facts about 
each flight.

<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast"><I>What is ADS-B?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
Airplanes periodically report their locations using the <I>Automatic 
Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B)</I> system, at 1090MHz and 
978MHz frequencies. OpenWebRX+ can listen to these frequencies and 
display received flight information to you.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="80%" STYLE="max-width:800px;" SRC="gfx/Mode-ADSB.png"></CENTER>
<P>
To receive ADS-B transmissions, select a profile containing one of the 
ADS-B frequencies. Since these transmissions require 2.4MHz of 
bandwidth, the profile must have at least 1.2MHz of bandwidth at each 
side of an ADS-B frequency.
</P>
<P>
Standard ADS-B frequencies are part of the OpenWebRX+ band plan and thus 
marked with green bookmarks. Once you click on an ADS-B bookmark, a 
panel will appear showing the reported aircraft with their flight data.
</P>
<P>
If you click on the <SPAN CLASS="Button">Map</SPAN> button, you should

<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><I>What is HFDL?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
The <I>HF Data Link (HFDL)</I> is a long-distance shortwave messaging 
system used to manage aircraft traffic around the globe. The system 
consists of around 15 ground stations (GS) covering the entire globe. 
HFDL messages may contain aircraft locations, telemetry, and text 
communications between ground stations and the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
All HFDL ground station frequencies are marked with yellow bookmarks in 
OpenWebRX+. Simply click on a bookmark to start receiving HFDL messages, 
or tune manually and select the <I>"HFDL"</I> digital mode.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="80%" STYLE="max-width:800px;" SRC="gfx/Mode-HFDL.png"></CENTER>
<P>
Keep in mind that you will not be able to hear all the ground stations 
from a single location: that is why there are multiple stations all 
around the globe. Also, each ground station has its own broadcasting 
schedule and thus may be silent at the present time.
</P>
<P>
If you click on the <SPAN CLASS="Button">Map</SPAN> button, you should

</DIV>
<P>
The <I>VHF Data Link Mode 2 (VDL2)</I> is an air band (VHF) messaging 
system aircraft use to communicate with the air traffic control within 
their line of sight. VDL2 messages may contain aircraft locations, 
telemetry, and text communications between aircraft and local ground 
control.
</P>
<P>
VDL2 frequencies are found at the end of the air band (108-137MHz) and 
marked with yellow bookmarks in OpenWebRX+. These bookmarks are commonly 
labelled with <I>"ARINC"</I> or <I>"SITA"</I>, depending on the company 
that manages each frequency. Simply click on a bookmark to start

The <I>Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System 
(ACARS)</I> is the original aircraft communications protocol, now mostly 
replaced with VDL2. Similarly to VDL2, ACARS uses the air band to carry 
telemetry and text messages between aircraft and local air traffic

<A NAME="Sea"><H2>Maritime Communications</H2></A>
<P>
Vessels at sea use shortwave bands and USB modulation for voice 
communications over long distances. Short range voice calls between 
ships and the shore occur in the 156-174MHz VHF "marine band". In 
addition to analog voice, the marine band contains
<A HREF="#HOW-AIS">AIS</A> location reporting,
<A HREF="#HOW-PAGER">paging</A>, and other digital services.
</P>
<P>
A lot of digital maritime communications fall under the
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Maritime_Distress_and_Safety_System">Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS)</A>,

<A NAME="HOW-AIS"><H3 CLASS="Section">Tracking Ships (AIS)</H3></A>
<DIV STYLE="text-align:right;">
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system"><I>What is AIS?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
Modern vessels report their locations using a VHF radio system known as 
<I>Automatic Identification System (AIS)</I>. If your OpenWebRX+ 
receiver is located near a large enough body of water, it may be able to 
receive AIS position reports and display them on the map.
</P>
<P>
AIS operates at two marine band frequencies, 161.975MHz and 162.025MHz. 
Once you select a profile containing these frequencies, you will see 
them marked with green bookmarks, since they are part of the band plan. 
Click on an "AIS" bookmark and a secondary waterfall should appear, 
together with the information panel showing received position reports.
</P>
<P>
Now, if you click on the <SPAN CLASS="Button">Map</SPAN> button, you

bubble showing some basic information about that ship.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="80%" STYLE="max-width:800px;" SRC="gfx/Map-AIS.png"></CENTER>
<P>
AIS identifies every vessel with a unique number known as MMSI. 
OpenWebRX+ shows these MMSI numbers, hyperlinking them to the

</DIV>
<P>
The <I>Maritime Safety Information (MSI)</I> messages are distributed 
on shortwave bands using SITOR-B protocol. The SITOR-B is somewhat 
similar to <A HREF="#HOW-RTTY">RTTY</A>, but adds redundancy and error 
checking.
</P>
<P>
Standard MSI frequencies are marked with yellow "MSI" bookmarks in 
OpenWebRX+. Simply click on a bookmark to start receiving MSI messages,

<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAVTEX"><I>What is NAVTEX?</I></A>
</DIV>
<P>
Similar to MSI, <I>Navigational Telex (NAVTEX)</I> uses SITOR-B 
protocol. Coastal stations send regular NAVTEX bulletins at prearranged 
shortwave frequencies. Each NAVTEX bulletin starts with a four-letter 
code specifying its origin, subject, and sequential number.
</P>
<P>
Standard NAVTEX frequencies are part of the OpenWebRX+ band plan and 
thus marked with green "NAVTEX" bookmarks. Simply click on a bookmark to 
start receiving NAVTEX messages, or tune manually and select the 
<I>"NAVTEX"</I> digital mode. Same NAVTEX transmissions can be received 
by selecting the <I>"SITOR-B"</I> digital mode, but OpenWebRX+ will not

<P>
<I>Digital Selective Calling (DSC)</I> uses predefined digital messages 
to report emergencies and other special events, as well as announce 
voice call frequencies. DSC operates in shortwave and marine (VHF) 
bands, but OpenWebRX+ is only able to decode shortwave DSC modes at the 
moment. In addition to sender's and receiver's MMSIs, DSC messages may
also carry their positions. For emergencies, the nature and location of 
emergency are reported.

total number is mainly limited by your computer performance. In this 
section, we are going to discuss the most common SDR devices, their 
capabilities, and how to set them up with OpenWebRX. Here is a short 
comparison of the most common SDR devices:

<A NAME="INSTALL-RTLSDR"><H3>RTL-SDR Devices</H3></A>
<P>
RTL-SDR is a large family of USB-connected SDR receivers based on the 
<I>Realtek RTL2832U</I> chipset. Under regular circumstances, these 
devices allow reception in the 24MHz-1766MHz range. They can also be 
persuaded to work in the 500kHz-14MHz range, although the reception 
quality is not very good there.
</P>
<UL>

<LI><B>RTLSDRv3</B>
<P>
The most common RTL-SDR device is
<A HREF="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/V3/">RTLSDRv3</A> from
<A HREF="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/">RTL-SDR Blog</A>.
In a lot of cases, the driver for this device is already installed in 
your Linux system. If it is not, you can install it with the following 
command:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo apt install rtl-sdr librtlsdr0 librtlsdr-dev
</PRE>

<LI><B>RTLSDRv4</B>
<P>
A somewhat better RTL-SDR version is
<A HREF="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/V4/">RTLSDRv4</A> from
<A HREF="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/">RTL-SDR Blog</A>.
This device officially supports the 500kHz-24MHz frequency range via the 
built-in transverter. It may require updated RTL-SDR drivers though. If 
your current drivers do not support <I>RTLSDRv4</I>, you may have to 
build and install the new drivers as follows:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev git cmake build-essential pkg-config debhelper
git clone https://github.com/rtlsdrblog/rtl-sdr-blog
cd rtl-sdr-blog
sudo dpkg-buildpackage -b --no-sign
cd ..
sudo dpkg -i librtlsdr0_*.deb librtlsdr-dev_*.deb rtl-sdr_*.deb
</PRE>

<LI><B>Receiving Shortwave Frequencies with RTL-SDR</B>
<P>
With RTLSDRv4 devices, you do not need to do anything special in order 
to use the 500kHz-24MHz frequency range. These frequencies will work out 
of the box, as long as you are using the correct device driver.
</P>
<P>
With RTLSDRv3 and similar devices, you will have to add the <I>"Direct 
Sampling"</I> option to each shortwave profile and set its value to 
<I>"Direct Sampling (Q branch)"</I>. With this option enabled, most 
RTL-SDR devices will be able to receive in the 500kHz-14MHz range. The 
14MHz-24MHz range will remain unusable.
</P>
<P>
Please, note that the default RTLSDR device entry in OpenWebRX has been 
created for RTLSDRv3, so all profiles under that entry have the 
<I>"Direct Sampling"</I> option enabled. <B>If you happen to have 
RTLSDRv4, make sure to remove the direct sampling option</B> from every 
RTLSDR profile. Otherwise, these profiles will not work.
</P>

<LI><B>Connecting Multiple RTL-SDR Devices</B>
<P>
When using multiple RTL-SDR devices with OpenWebRX, you will have to 
assign each of them a unique serial number with the following shell 
command:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
rtl_eeprom -d &lt;device-index&gt; -s &lt;serial-number&gt;
</PRE>
Once assigned, the serial number will be persistently stored within
each device. To make OpenWebRX distinguish between your devices, add
the <I>"Device Identifier"</I> option to each device and set it to
device's unique serial number.
</P>
<P>
To see indices and serial numbers of your RTL-SDR devices, run the same
command without arguments:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
rtl_eeprom
</PRE>
</P>
</UL>

<A NAME="INSTALL-SDRPLAY"><H3>SDRPlay (RSP) Devices</H3></A>
<P>
RSP is a family of USB-connected SDR receivers based on the <I>Mirics 
MSI001 / MSI2500</I> chipset. The official RSP devices are made and sold 
by
<A HREF="https://www.sdrplay.com/">SDRPlay</A>,
but since the basic schematics are standard, there are many inferior, 
but cheaper Chinese RSP clones on the market. These devices are capable 
of continuous reception in the 0-2GHz range, with bandwidth of up to 
6Msps. This bandwidth can be further widened to 10Msps at the cost of 
losing some bit resolution.
</P>
<UL>

<LI><B>Making RSP Device Work with OpenWebRX+</B>
<P>
To make an RSP device work with OpenWebRX+, you will first have to 
download and install the latest SDRPlay API for your version of
Linux from the
<A HREF="https://www.sdrplay.com/downloads/">SDRPlay website</A>.
<B>Your RSP device will not work unless you install the SDRPlay API.</B> 
</P>
<P>
Once you have SDRPlay API installed, install the SoapySDRPlay3 package 
from OpenWebRX+ repositories as follows:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo apt install soapysdr-module-sdrplay3
</PRE>
During installation, the SoapySDRPlay3 package will also install the 
latest SoapySDR and remove all locally built SoapySDR files from 
<I>/usr/local</I> to prevent conflicts between packaged and locally 
built versions of SoapySDR.
</P>

<LI><B>Solving SDRPlay API Problems</B>
<P>
You may encounter a situation where installed SDRPlay API breaks down
on your Linux system due to incompatible system libraries. If you look 
at the SDRPlay service logs:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
journalctl -u sdrplay
</PRE>
and see the following messages:
<PRE>
/opt/sdrplay_api/sdrplay_apiService:
/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found
(required by /opt/sdrplay_api/sdrplay_apiService)
</PRE>
then the only way to fix it is to downgrade to an older version of the 
SDRPlay API. Install SDRPlay API v3.07 from the
<A HREF="https://www.sdrplay.com/downloads/">SDRPlay website</A>,
then downgrade SoapySDRPlay3 to a compatible version and prevent it from 
further upgrades:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo apt install soapysdr-module-sdrplay3=0.8.6
sudo apt-mark hold soapysdr-module-sdrplay3
</PRE>
</P>

<LI><B>Connecting Multiple RSP Devices</B>
<P>
Each genuine RSP device has a unique serial number assigned at the 
factory. You can see these serial numbers with the following command:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo SoapySDRUtil --probe="driver=sdrplay"
</PRE>
To make OpenWebRX distinguish between your devices, add the <I>"Device 
Identifier"</I> option to each device and set it to device's unique 
serial number.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-made RSP clones all come with the same serial number and
thus <B>only one</B> Chinese RSP clone can be used with the SDRPlay API.
A workaround to this problem is to downgrade SDRPlay API to v3.07 and
install the corresponding SoapySDRPlay3 package version, since older 
SDRPlay API uses USB port numbers as serial numbers. Install SDRPlay API 
v3.07 from the
<A HREF="https://www.sdrplay.com/downloads/">SDRPlay website</A>,
then downgrade SoapySDRPlay3 to a compatible version and prevent it from 
further upgrades:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo apt install soapysdr-module-sdrplay3=0.8.6
sudo apt-mark hold soapysdr-module-sdrplay3
</PRE>

<A NAME="INSTALL-AIRSPY"><H3>Airspy Devices</H3></A>
<P>
Airspy is a family of USB-connected SDR receivers based on the 
<I>Realtek R820T2</I> chipset. These devices are made and sold by
<A HREF="https://airspy.com/">Airspy</A>.
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Airspy R2 and Airspy Mini</B>
<P>
Most Linux distributions will have
<A HREF="https://airspy.com/airspy-r2/">Airspy R2</A> and
<A HREF="https://airspy.com/airspy-mini/">Airspy Mini</A>
drivers installed by default. If this is not the case, you can install 
the drivers as follows:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo apt install soapysdr-module-airspy
</PRE>
</P>
<LI><B>Airspy HF+</B>
<P>
The <A HREF="https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-plus/">Airspy HF+</A>
does not have a packaged driver yet, so you will need to compile it as 
follows:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev git cmake build-essential pkg-config debhelper libairspyhf-dev
git clone https://github.com/pothosware/SoapyAirspyHF.git
cd SoapyAirspyHF
sed -i 's/soapysdr0.7-module/soapysdr0.8-module/' debian/control
mv debian/soapysdr0.{7,8}-module-airspyhf.install
sudo dpkg-buildpackage -b --no-sign
cd ..
dpkg -i soapysdr0.8-module-airspyhf_*.deb soapysdr-module-airspyhf_*.deb
</PRE>
</P>
</UL>

<A NAME="INSTALL-HL2"><H3>Hermes Lite 2</H3></A>
<P>
Hermes Lite 2 (HL2) is a hobbyist-designed SDR transceiver based on high 
performance ADC and FPGA chips. Transmit capability aside, HL2 can 
receive up to four independent chunks of spectrum in the 0-30MHz range, 
with each chunk limited to the 384kHz width. This makes HL2 ideal for 
monitoring multiple shortwave bands at the same time.
</P>
<UL>

<LI><B>Making HL2 Work with OpenWebRX+</B>
<P>
To make HL2 work with OpenWebRX+, you will have to connect HL2 to your 
OpenWebRX+ computer with an Ethernet cable. Once HL2 is connected and 
powered up, it will eventually assign itself the "local" IP address of 
169.254.19.221. You then need to install the <I>HPSDR Connector</I>
package from OpenWebRX+ repositories, as follows:
<PRE>
sudo apt install hpsdrconnector
</PRE>
Once installed, you should be able to add new HPSDR devices in the 
OpenWebRX+ settings. When adding an HPSDR device, make sure you add the 
<I>"Remote IP"</I> option and set it to the default HL2 IP address of 
169.254.19.221.
</P>

<LI><B>Adding Multiple HPSDR Devices</B>
<P>
As has been said before, your HL2 can receive up to four distinct chunks 
of the shortwave spectrum, representing each chunk with a separate 
virtual "device". To make use of this capability though, you will have 
to add four separate HPSDR devices to OpenWebRX+. Point all four devices 
to the same IP address. <B>Make sure all HPSDR devices use the same 
sampling rate</B>, as HL2 runs all its RX channels at the same rate.
</P>
</UL>

<A NAME="INSTALL-HACKRF"><H3>HackRF One</H3></A>
<P>
HackRF One is an open source, USB-connected SDR. In most cases, HackRF 
One drivers should already be present in your system. If this is not the 
case, install the drivers as follows:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo apt install soapysdr-module-hackrf
</PRE>
</P>

<A NAME="INSTALL-ANTENNA"><H3>Choosing an Antenna</H3></A>
<P>
It is recommended to connect antenna via a shielded cable in order to 
keep it away from the receiver and other interference sources. Possible 
interference sources include power supplies, phone chargers, LED lights, 
refrigerators, air conditioners, water pumps, and other devices. Power 
lines inside your home may carry this interference all over the place. 
Also, powerline network adapters are especially bad sources of electric 
noise, so avoid using them.
</P>
<P>
Your antenna choice will always depend on the frequencies you would like 
to receive and the amount of radio interference at your location. In 
this section, we will go over some available options.
</P>
<UL>

<LI><B>Telescopic Antennas</B>
<P>
A telescopic antenna is going to be resonant (most sensitive) to 
wavelengths that are twice the antenna length. Their limited length 
makes telescopic antennas the best at FM, VHF, and UHF bands. These
antennas can be used for shortwave (&lt;30MHz) reception, but are
not very good there.
</P>
<P>
All telescopic antennas work the same, with longer antennas being more 
sensitive at lower frequencies. More expensive telescopic antennas are 
made of sturdier materials and offer better articulation, but not better 
reception. CB telescopic antennas are a <B>special case</B>, since they 
contain circuitry biasing them in favor of the CB band.
</P>
<P>
Grounding the receiver will improve antenna performance. Also, a 
telescopic dipole ("TV whiskers") will have better performance than a 
single whip, since it has bigger total length and does not require 
grounding.
</P>

<LI><B>Long Wire Antennas (LW, MW, SW)</B>
<P>
The optimal length of an antenna should be close to 1/2 of the 
wavelength you expect to receive. For example, if you are planning to 
listen to the 25m shortwave band, the optimal antenna length will be 25 
/ 2 &thickapprox; 12.5 meters, which makes shortwave telescopic antennas 
rather difficult to implement. It is still possible though to attach a 
really long wire to the antenna connector, throwing it outside or 
wrapping it around a room as necessary.
</P>
<P>
Grounding the receiver will improve antenna performance. Also, a dipole 
made of two pieces of wire will have better performance than a single 
wire, since it has bigger total length and does not require grounding.
</P>

<LI><B>Rubber Whip Antennas (VHF, UHF)</B>
<P>
At shorter wavelengths (80MHz+), it is possible to use short rubber whip 
antennas made for the use in walkie talkies, first responder radios, and 
scanners. These antennas are small, very portable, and offer decent 
reception in the FM, VHF, and UHF bands. It is necessary to say though 
that these antennas are <B>specifically tuned</B> for the VHF and UHF 
bands and thus become useless in the LW, MW, and SW bands.
</P>

<LI><B>Non-Resonant Loop Antennas</B>
<P>
As said before, the electromagnetic interference is often a huge problem 
when listening to the radio indoors or in urban environment. The 
magnetic loop antennas attempt to work around this interference by 
receiving the magnetic component of the wave rather than the noisier 
electric component.
</P>
<P>
A typical non-resonant loop antenna consists of one or more relatively 
small (&thickapprox;1m in diameter) loops of wire connected to a 
receiver via a tiny transformer ("balun" or "unun"). The total surface 
of the wire loop determines how much magnetic flux it receives, making 
bigger loops more sensitive. A loop antenna is directional:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>
<B>At the wavelengths much longer than the loop size (LW, MW, SW)</B>, 
the maximum gain is achieved when a side of the loop is directed towards 
the signal source. <B>The loop is not resonant at these frequencies,</B>
i.e. it does not favor any specific frequency.
</P>
<LI>
<P>
<B>At the wavelengths comparable to the loop size (FM, VHF, UHF)</B>, 
the maximum gain is achieved when the loop surface is directed towards 
the signal source, same as if it were a dipole. <B>The loop becomes
resonant at these frequencies.</B>
</P>
</UL>
<P>
While loop antennas are less susceptible to electromagnetic interference, 
they are also less sensitive to the actual signals. Thus, many 
commercial loop antennas include <B>low-noise amplifiers (LNAs)</B>, 
requiring a power source. If your loop antenna does not have an LNA, 
consider adding one. Some commercially available loop antennas are 
<I>YouLoop</I>, <I>MLA-30+</I>, and <I>GA-450</I>.
</P>

<LI><B>MiniWhip Antennas</B>
<P>
A MiniWhip is an active antenna made of a small metal plate ("probe") 
and a low-noise amplifier (LNA). It measures the electric field strength 
at the probe, making it a tiny receive-only antenna for a wide range of 
frequencies.
</P>
<P>
Being an active antenna, MiniWhip does require a power source. Also, 
since MiniWhip is essentially a non-resonant electric field probe, it is 
highly susceptible to interference. Thus, you will need to install it in 
an area free of electromagnetic noise.
</P>

</UL>

<A NAME="AdminFeatures"><H2>Administrator Features</H2></A>
<P>
This section discusses administering an OpenWebRX server and how it can 
be used besides providing public access to radio waves.
</P>

<A NAME="HOW-BACKGROUND"><H3>Background Decoding</H3></A>
<P>
As a <B>server administrator</B>, you can make OpenWebRX server 
<B>automatically decode radio transmissions</B> when someone is 
listening to a profile with these transmissions. This feature can be 
used to receive SSTV images, faxes, monitor digital HAM traffic, track 
airplanes, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
To start with background decoding, go to <I>"Settings | Background 
Decoding"</I>, check the <I>"Enable background decoding services"</I> 
option, and select transmission modes you would like to receive and 
decode automatically. Make sure you only select the ones you really 
need, since running too many background decoders will slow your server 
down, a lot.
</P>
<P>
Now, go to an SDR device you want to use for background decoding, let us 
say <I>"Settings | SDR Devices and Profiles | &lt;Device&gt;"</I>, and 
add the <I>"Run background services on this device"</I> option. Once you 
have added this option, make sure it is enabled.
</P>
<P>
At this point, every time someone connects and listens to a 
<I>&lt;Device&gt;</I> profile, OpenWebRX will <B>automatically decode 
all enabled signal types at frequencies marked with green bookmarks</B>, 
i.e. everything that is part of the band plan. If the decoded data is an 
image or a message log, these will be saved to the <I>/tmp</I> folder 
and shown once you click the <SPAN CLASS="Button">Files</SPAN> button. 
Location reports, such as FT8, WSPR, APRS, and others, will show up on 
the map, when you click the <SPAN CLASS="Button">Map</SPAN> button.
</P>
<P>
In order to enable background decoding at a frequency that is <B>not</B> 
part of the band plan (<B>no</B> green bookmark), you will have to add 
that frequency to the band plan by editing the following file:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">sudo nano /etc/openwebrx/bands.json</PRE>
<P>
There are also region-specific band plan files in the same folder. <B>If 
you have selected a region-specific band plan in <I>"Settings | 
General"</I>, edit that band plan instead</B>. Prior to editing a band 
plan file, make sure you <B>create a backup copy</B>, in case something 
goes wrong. After editing and saving the file, restart OpenWebRX as 
follows and make sure there is a green bookmark at the frequency you 
added:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">sudo systemctl restart openwebrx</PRE>
<P>
A typical <I>bands.json</I> frequency entry will look as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
"frequencies": {
    "&lt;mode&gt;": &lt;frequency&gt;,
    ...
}
</PRE>
<P>
<P>
The background decoding in OpenWebRX+ supports the following modes: 
<I>
"ft8", "wspr", "jt65", "jt9", "ft4", "fst4", "fst4w", "q65", "msk144", 
"js8", "packet", "ais", "sstv", "fax", "navtex", "dsc", "page", "eas", 
"ism", "hfdl", "vdl2", "acars", "adsb", "audio".
</I>
If you have multiple frequencies associated with the same mode, 
enter them as a list:
</P>
<PRE>
"frequencies": {
    "&lt;mode&gt;": [ &lt;frequency1&gt;, &lt;frequency2&gt;, ... ],
    ...
}
</PRE>
<P>
Finally, if you would like to specify an underlying modulation, such as 
<I>"lsb"</I>, <I>"usb"</I>, <I>"am"</I>, <I>"nfm"</I>, <I>"sam"</I>, or 
<I>"cw"</I>, enter it as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
"frequencies": {
    "&lt;mode&gt;": { "frequency": &lt;frequency&gt;, "underlying": "&lt;modulation&gt;" },
    ...
}
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Here is an example of two FT4 frequencies, using their default USB 
modulation, and two SSTV frequencies using different modulations:
</P>
<PRE>
"frequencies": {
    "ft4": [ 3568000, 3575000 ],
    "sstv": [
        { "frequency": 3730000, "underlying": "lsb" },
        { "frequency": 3845000, "underlying": "usb" }
    ],
    ...
}
</PRE>
<P>
Here is another example of an FM-modulated VHF frequency. With the 
<I>"Settings | Background Decoding | Audio Recorder"</I> option enabled, 
this entry will make OpenWebRX+ record audio to an MP3 file and let 
users access it via the file browser page:
</P>
<PRE>
"frequencies": {
    "audio": { "frequency": 145700000, "underlying": "nfm" },
    ...
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="HOW-SCHEDULED"><H3>Scheduled Decoding</H3></A>
<P>
In the <A HREF="#HOW-BACKGROUND">previous section</A>, we discussed how 
OpenWebRX can decode radio transmissions automatically, while someone is 
using it. In this section, we are going to <B>make OpenWebRX run the 
radio and receive signals on its own</B>, when nobody is using it.
</P>
<P>
Start with an SDR device where you previously enabled background 
services by going to <I>"Settings | SDR Devices and Profiles | 
&lt;Device&gt;"</I>. Add the <I>"Scheduler"</I> option to this device
and find the newly added scheduler selector among other settings.
It is going to offer you two different schedule models:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><B>Daylight Scheduler</B><BR>
The daylight scheduler lets you select three profiles to run on the 
device during the day, the night, and the "greyline" period (i.e. dawn 
and dusk). Since radio waves propagation depends on the time of a day, 
this scheme provides easy to configure, yet functional schedule.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Static Scheduler</B><BR>
The static scheduler lets you define your own schedule of as many 
entries as you like, with minute precision. While such a schedule is 
more difficult to add, it gives you flexibility to switch through 
several different profiles each hour.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
Once you have your schedule added and saved, <B>OpenWebRX will switch 
device between scheduled profiles, as long as nobody is using this 
device</B>. Once all the users disconnect, OpenWebRX will return the SDR 
device to its currently scheduled profile. It will also run any 
applicable background decoders you enabled earlier, reporting received 
data to the map or saving it to the file storage.
</P>

<A NAME="HOW-REPORTING"><H3>Reporting Decoded Data</H3></A>
<P>
In the
<A HREF="#HOW-BACKGROUND">two</A> <A HREF="#HOW-SCHEDULED">previous</A>
sections, we discussed how OpenWebRX can be configured to automatically 
decode various radio transmissions. In this section, we are going to 
discuss sending the decoded data to online services, such as
<A HREF="https://aprs.fi/">APRS-IS</A>,
<A HREF="https://pskreporter.info/">PSKReporter</A>,
<A HREF="https://wsprnet.org/">WSPRnet</A>, or
<A HREF="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</A>.
To configure online reporting, go to the <I>"Settings | Spotting and 
Reporting"</I> settings page. There are three sections there, for the 
three types of data OpenWebRX can report:
</P>
<UL>

<LI><P><B>APRS-IS</B><BR>
The received APRS position reports can be sent to the
<A HREF="https://www.aprs2.net/">APRS-IS network</A>.
In order to do that, fill in your APRS callsign and the nearest server 
address. You may also need to provide APRS-IS network password. Finally, 
check the <I>"Send received APRS data to APRS-IS"</I> option. The 
reported data will show up at the
<A HREF="https://aprs.fi/">APRS.fi map</A>.
Please, note that 
<A HREF="https://aprs.fi/">APRS.fi</A>
does not show multiply reported spots, so some of your reports may not 
show there.
</P>
<P>
If you would also like to report your <B>receiver position</B> to 
APRS-IS, check the <I>"Send the receiver position to the APRS-IS 
network"</I> option and fill in information about your receiver and 
antenna specifics.
</P>
<P>
Please, note that <B>only one decoder can send data to the APRS-IS 
network</B> using the same callsign. Thus, if you have more than one 
APRS decoder running (for example, at 144.39MHz and 145.825MHz), some of 
your reports will not make it through. To fix this issue, <B>disable all 
but one APRS frequency</B> in the band plan file.
</P>

<LI><P><B>PSKReporter</B><BR>
OpenWebRX can report FT8, FT4, JT9, JT65, FST4, JS8, Q65, WSPR, FST4W, 
and MSK144 transmissions to the
<A HREF="https://pskreporter.info/">PSKReporter</A>
website. All you need to do is check the <I>"Enable sending spots to 
pskreporter.info"</I> option and fill callsign field with a unique name. 
It <B>does not</B> have to be your official HAM callsign, but most 
people who have HAM callsigns use them here. The reported data will show 
up at the
<A HREF="https://pskreporter.info/pskmap">PSKReporter map</A>.
You may also want to describe your antenna in the antenna information 
field, so that other people know how you received the data you are 
reporting.
</P>

<LI><P><B>WSPRnet</B><BR>
The
<A HREF="https://wsprnet.org/">WSPRnet</A>
website only accepts WSPR and FST4W reports. To enable it, check the 
<I>"Enable sending spots to wsprnet.org"</I> option and enter your 
unique name into the callsign field. It <B>does not</B> have to be your 
official HAM callsign, but most people who have HAM callsigns use them 
here. The reported data will show up at the
<A HREF="http://www.wsprnet.org/drupal/wsprnet/map">WSPRnet map</A>.
</P>

<LI><P><B>MQTT</B><BR>
The
<A HREF="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</A>
is a protocol for reporting IOT events to multiple remote subscribers. 
In order to use MQTT, you will need to have an MQTT broker, such as
<A HREF="https://mosquitto.org/">Mosquitto</A>.
Once you have a broker, enable MQTT reporting by checking the <I>"Enable 
publishing reports to MQTT"</I> option and entering your broker address 
into the appropriate field. You may also have to enter your client ID, 
username, and password. By default, OpenWebRX+ reports all its events 
under the <I>"openwebrx"</I> topic, but that can be changed by entering 
your own topic name into the <I>"MQTT topic"</I> field.

<A NAME="HOW-CONFIG-MAP"><H3>Configuring Map</H3></A>
<P>
OpenWebRX+ offers <B>two map options: <I>Google Maps</I> and a 
collection of free maps</B> based on the <I>Leaflet</I> library. The 
very popular <I>OpenStreetMap</I> is part of that collection.
</P>
<P>
The <I>Google Maps</I> implementation is more detailed and polished, but 
it may require you to register your credit card with Google to receive 
an API key. Google may then charge your credit card if you exceed a 
certain limit of the <I>Google Maps</I> accesses.
</P>
<P>
The <I>OpenStreetMap</I> and other maps included with the <I>Leaflet</I> 
are less detailed, but they are totally free. Also, the <I>Leaflet</I> 
implementation includes some extra layers for weather, maritime 
annotations, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
<B>In order to configure the default map</B>, go to <I>"Settings
| General | Map | Map Type"</I> and select the map you would like to 
show to the users by default. Remember that a user can always switch 
maps by clicking on the <SPAN CLASS="Button">Map</SPAN> button. Other 
map-related options available from the same settings section are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><B>Google Maps API Key</B><BR>
This is where you enter the <I>Google Maps</I> API key you received from 
Google. Leave this field empty if you have no API key. A lot of times,
<I>Google Maps</I> will work anyway, for some reason.
</P>
<LI><P><B>OpenWeatherMap API Key</B><BR>
If you would like to see global weather on <I>Leaflet</I> maps, consider 
getting an <I>OpenWeatherMap</I> API key and entering it here. These 
keys are free, for limited amount of functionality. Without this key, 
OpenWebRX+ will only be able to show you US weather, obtained from 
<I>WeatherRadar</I>.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Map Retention Time</B><BR>
This is the time, in seconds, the received location reports stay visible 
on the map. A location report will start getting dimmer once it becomes 
older than half of the retention time. Once it reaches the retention 
time, a location report will disappear from the map.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Callsign Database URL</B><BR>

<A NAME="HOW-LIMITS"><H3>Limiting Receiver Use</H3></A>
<P>
As a <B>server administrator</B>, you may have legal or technical 
reasons to <B>restrict</B> your OpenWebRX server use by the public. 
Always check what radio frequencies and modes you are allowed to listen 
to at your location. <B>Do not</B> offer prohibited frequencies and 
modes to the public. Following restrictions are available in the 
<I>"Settings | General | Receiver Limits"</I>:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><B>Maximum Number of Clients</B><BR>
This setting determines how many people can connect to your OpenWebRX 
server at once. Anyone trying to connect to a "full" server will be 
shown an error message and refused service.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Maximum Number of Files</B><BR>
This setting determines how many SSTV images, faxes, and other files 
received from the air OpenWebRX+ is allowed to keep before it starts 
deleting oldest files. The received files can be seen by pressing the 
<SPAN CLASS="Button">Files</SPAN> button at the top of the receiver web 
page.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Session Timeout</B><BR>
This value, in seconds, determines how long a user is allowed to use the 
OpenWebRX+ receiver. Reloading receiver's web page restarts the time 
though, so the timeout is mostly there for people who leave their 
computers with the OpenWebRX+ page open.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Usage Policy URL</B><BR>
This web page is shown to a user once their session times out. The 
default page explains why there is a timeout and lets users find other 
online receivers to listen to.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Allow users to chat with each other</B><BR>
Disable this option if you want to disable the built-in chat facility. 
When disabled, the chat panel turns into the log panel that does not 
accept any input.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Allow users to record received audio</B><BR>
Disable this option if you do not want your users to record any audio 
they are listening to. When disabled, the <SPAN CLASS="Button">REC</SPAN>
button will disappear from the user interface. Please, do keep in mind 
that this <B>does not</B> prevent your users from recording their audio 
by some other means.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Allow users to change center frequency</B><BR>
Enable this option if you would like to let your OpenWebRX+ users
"side-step" their current profile by right-clicking the round arrow 
buttons. Since this change will occur to all the users listening to the 
same profile, it makes sense to disable it on the servers with many 
people listening to the same profiles.
</P>
<LI><P><B>Magic Key</B><BR>
When the magic key string is filled in (i.e. not empty), OpenWebRX+ will 
only allow side-stepping profiles to people who know the magic key and 
provide it as follows:
<PRE>http://openwebrx.receiver.org:8073/#<B>key=&lt;magic-key&gt;</B></PRE>
</P>
</UL>

<A NAME="HOW-USERS"><H3>Monitoring Receiver Use</H3></A>
<P>
OpenWebRX+ <B>lets its administrator monitor connections</B> to the 
server and <B>ban abusive users</B>. Please, note that since the main 
goal of the OpenWebRX project is to provide free, open online radio, 
this facility should be used with extreme care. If you want to have a 
truly private OpenWebRX server, consider closing it to public access 
instead.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="80%" STYLE="max-width:800px;" SRC="gfx/ClientMonitor.png"></CENTER>

In order to see currently connected clients, click on the
<SPAN CLASS="Button">Settings</SPAN> button and scroll to the bottom of 
the page, until you see the <I>"Clients"</I> display, as shown above. 
There, you will be able to <SPAN CLASS="Button">ban</SPAN> client's IP 
address for a selected amount of time, or
<SPAN CLASS="Button">unban</SPAN> previously banned addresses. A banned 
client will still be able to see the map and files, but won't be able to

<PRE>proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;</PRE>
</P>

<A NAME="HOW-MQTT"><H3>Advanced MQTT Reporting</H3></A>
<P>
As <A HREF="#HOW-REPORTING">discussed earlier</A>, OpenWebRX can report 
received data to an <A HREF="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT broker</A>. The 
data for each mode is sent under the <I>"openwebrx/&lt;mode&gt;"</I> 
topic. For example, FT8 data is reported as <I>"openwebrx/FT8"</I>. A 
typical report will look as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
{
  "mode":      "FT8",
  "timestamp": 1722482895000,
  "freq":      7074985, 
  "msg":       "CQ YV6BXN FK60",
  "callsign":  "YV6BXN",
  "locator":   "FK60"
}
</PRE>
<P>
The common fields present in most reports are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>mode</B><BR>
Mode used to receive the data.
<LI><B>freq</B><BR>
Frequency where the data has been received, in hertz.
<LI><B>timestamp</B><BR>
Reception time, in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
</UL>

<H4>Reporting Server Startup and Shutdown</H4>
<P>
In addition to reporting received data, OpenWebRX+ uses MQTT to report 
SDR device changes and other internal events. For example, when an 
OpenWebRX+ server starts up or shuts down, it sends the following event 
under the <I>"openwebrx/RX"</I> topic:
</P>
<PRE>
{
  "mode":      "RX",
  "timestamp": 1722737506393,
  "version":   "v1.2.64", 
  "state":     "ServerStarted"
}
</PRE>
<P>
The <I>"state"</I> parameter can be either <I>"ServerStarted"</I> or
<I>"ServerStopped"</I>.
</P>

<H4>Reporting SDR Device Changes</H4>
<P>
OpenWebRX+ reports SDR device changes under the <I>"openwebrx/RX"</I> 
topic that can be used by various automation scripts. Thus, an SDR 
profile change will be reported as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
{
  "mode":       "RX",
  "timestamp":  1722483751451,
  "source_id":  "rspdx", 
  "source":     "RSPdx",
  "profile_id": "air-1",
  "profile":    "Air Band 118-120", 
  "freq":       118900000,
  "samplerate": 2000000
}
</PRE>
<P>
The most important fields in the above event are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>source_id</B><BR>
SDR device where profile is being changed. Also see <I>"source"</I> for 
a human-readable device name.
<LI><B>profile_id</B><BR>
The new profile. Also see <I>"profile"</I> for a human-readable profile 
name.
<LI><B>frequency</B><BR>
The center frequency of the new profile, in hertz.
<LI><B>samplerate</B><BR>
The width of the new profile, in hertz.
</UL>
<P>
When an SDR device starts or stops operating, a state change event is
sent to MQTT:
</P>
<PRE>
{
  "mode":      "RX",
  "timestamp": 1722483751451,
  "source_id": "rspdx", 
  "source":    "RSPdx",
  "state":     "Running"
}
</PRE>
<P>
As seen above, the state change event is very similar to a profile 
change, but carries SDR state instead of profile information.
</P>

<H4>Reporting User Activity</H4>
<P>
OpenWebRX+ reports user activities under the <I>"openwebrx/CLIENT"</I> 
topic. Thus, a user connecting or disconnecting from the server will be 
reported as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
{
  "mode":      "CLIENT",
  "timestamp": 1722738356255, 
  "ip":        "::ffff:101.23.45.67",
  "state":     "Connected",
  "banned":    false
}
</PRE>
<P>
The <I>"state"</I> parameter can be either <I>"Connected"</I> or 
<I>"Disconnected"</I>. When a user sends a chat message, that message is 
similarly reported under the <I>"openwebrx/CLIENT"</I> topic:
</P>
<PRE>
{
  "mode":      "CLIENT", 
  "timestamp": 1722738521609,
  "ip":        "::ffff:101.23.45.67",
  "name":      "Nickname",
  "message":   "The message text.",
  "state":     "ChatMessage",
  "banned":    false
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="HOW-PLUGINS"><H3>JavaScript Plugins</H3></A>
<P>
Stanislav Lechev (LZ2SLL) has developed a
<A HREF="https://0xaf.github.io/openwebrxplus-plugins/">JavaScript plugins framework</A>
for OpenWebRX+. There is a bunch of plugins available from his
<A HREF="https://github.com/0xAF/openwebrxplus-plugins">GitHub repository</A>.
JavaScript plugins operate in a browser at the client side, rather 
than the server side, and allow to customize user interface. In order 
to enable JavaScript plugins, rename the following file:
</P>
<PRE>htdocs/plugins/receiver/init.js.sample</PRE>
<P>
into <I>init.js</I> and edit it to enable or disable individual plugins. 
The plugins themselves are stored in the following folders:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><B>htdocs/plugins/receiver</B><BR>
Plugins placed into this folder will be loaded into the main receiver 
page.
</P>
<LI><P><B>htdocs/plugins/map</B><BR>
Plugins placed into this folder will be loaded into the map view page.
</P>
</UL>

<A NAME="HOW-RIGCONTROL"><H3>External Transceiver Rig Control</H3></A>
<P>
For HAM operators, OpenWebRX+ offers a way to send tuning frequency and 
modulation changes to a transceiver rig connected to the OpenWebRX+ 
server. This is done using
<A HREF="https://hamlib.github.io/">Hamlib</A>
tools, so you will need to install Hamlib prior to enabling rig control 
in OpenWebRX+.
</P>
<P>
Please, keep in mind that <B>unless you are running a private OpenWebRX+ 
server, letting it control your transceiver is not the best idea</B>, 
even though OpenWebRX+ cannot be used to trigger actual radio 
transmission.
</P>
<P>
Once you have installed Hamlib and connected your transceiver to the 
OpenWebRX+ server, go to
<I>"Settings | Spotting and Reporting | RigControl Settings"</I>
and select your transceiver model. Then enter the name of a Linux device 
your rig is connected to (serial, USB, etc). For network-connected rigs, 
enter column-separated IP address and port instead.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="80%" STYLE="max-width:800px;" SRC="gfx/RigControl-Settings.png"></CENTER>
<P>
If OpenWebRX+ is unable to open your Linux device due to access 
restrictions, check what group that device belongs to and add the 
<I>"openwebrx"</I> user to the same group:
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
$ <B>ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0</B>
crw-rw---- 1 root <B>dialout</B> 188, 0 Jan  7 15:28 /dev/ttyUSB0
$ <B>sudo usermod -a -G dialout openwebrx</B>
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
At this point, you can enable global rig control for all SDR devices and 
profiles by checking the <I>"Enable sending changes to a standalone 
transceiver"</I> option. Most HAM operators would like to restrict rig 
control to certain (shortwave) profiles though. To do that, <B>keep the 
global enable option off</B>. Go to a desired profile instead and add 
the <I>"Enable sending changes to a standalone transceiver"</I> option 
there.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="80%" STYLE="max-width:800px;" SRC="gfx/RigControl-Profile.png"></CENTER>

<A NAME="HOW-SATDUMP"><H3>Receiving Satellite Data</H3></A>
<P>
To receive satellite weather maps, OpenWebRX+ integrates with the
<A HREF="https://www.satdump.org/">SatDump</A>
satellite decoder. Unfortunately, since SatDump is not a real-time tool, 
the online decoding is not possible. Hence, the users of your receiver 
will not be able to make use of SatDump and that is why <B>OpenWebRX+ 
satellite data support is only available for backup decoding</B>.
</P>
<P>
If you are running a private OpenWebRX+ server and would like to use it 
to receive satellite data, you can manually enable SatDump support and 
receive satellite weather images as follows:
</P>

<OL>
<LI><P>
<B>Install SatDump</B> by following instructions from the 
<A HREF="https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump">official GitHub repository</A>.
You can also try installing SatDump from packages available at their
<A HREF="https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump">downloads page</A>,
but these may not work on your specific Linux flavor. Source code
compilation is more reliable, although it does take a significant
amount of time.
</P>

<LI><P>
<B>Enable background decoding</B> for selected satellites by checking
them in <I>"Settings | Background Decoding"</I>.
</P>

<LI><P>
<B>Enable running background services</B> on a chosen SDR device via 
<I>"Settings | SDR Devices and Profiles | &lt;Device&gt;"</I>, add a
schedule to this device, and create schedule entries for the satellites
you would like to receive and decode.
</P>

<LI><P>
<B>All received data is stored</B> in the <I>"/tmp/satdump"</I> folder. 
For the NOAA decoder, you will see complete images there. For the METEOR 
decoder, you will get a .CADU file with data. Use SatDump on your 
personal computer to convert this file to actual images.

<A NAME="FAQ-BROKEN"><H3>OpenWebRX broken after upgrade!</H3></A>
<P>
In a desktop browser, try reloading receiver web page while holding the 
<SPAN CLASS="Button">SHIFT</SPAN> key. In a mobile browser, clear 
browser cache and reload the page. If this does not help, try restarting 
the computer running OpenWebRX.
</P>

<A NAME="FAQ-FEATURES"><H3>OpenWebRX features do not show up!</H3></A>
<P>
Click on <I>"Settings | Feature Report"</I> and see if the features you 
are interested in show up as enabled there. If a feature is disabled, 
the report will tell you what you should do to enable it.
</P>

<A NAME="FAQ-DMR"><H3>Digital voice modes do not show up!</H3></A>
<P>
Digital voice modes (DMR, D-STAR, YSF, NXDN) require AMBE codec 
algorithms patented by <I>Digital Voice Systems Inc</I>. Because of 
that, neither OpenWebRX nor OpenWebRX+ include digital voice support out 
of the box. <B>It is your personal responsibility</B> to add necessary 
pieces to your own OpenWebRX installation.
</P>
<P>
The proper, legally responsible way to add digital voice modes to 
OpenWebRX is to attach a
<A HREF="https://github.com/jketterl/openwebrx/wiki/AMBE-vocoder-device-notes">licensed USB dongle</A>
that implements AMBE codecs in the hardware. Both OpenWebRX and 
OpenWebRX+ will support common AMBE dongle models with minimal
<A HREF="https://github.com/jketterl/openwebrx/wiki/AMBE-vocoder-device-notes">configuration effort</A>.
</P>
<P>
If you do not wish to use an AMBE codec dongle for whatever reason, 
there is an unlicensed
<A HREF="https://github.com/szechyjs/mbelib">MBELib</A>
software implementation with rather questionable origins. The MBELib use 
may be interpreted as a patent violation. If you are ok with it, there 
is <A HREF="install-softmbe.sh">a script</A> that adds MBELib support to 
OpenWebRX. Run it as follows:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">sudo install-softmbe.sh</PRE>
<P>
After installing digital voice support by either method, visit 
<I>"Settings | Feature Report"</I> page to verify that the installation 
succeeded. You should now see digital voice buttons at the receiver web 
page.
</P>

<A NAME="FAQ-SDRPLAY"><H3>My SDRplay device does not work reliably!</H3></A>
<P>
SDRplay devices and their clones are notoriously glitchy and require a 
good power source for reliable operation. If you experience timeouts or 
failures with these devices, try connecting them via a powered USB hub. 
If this does not help, and you have a genuine SDRplay device (not a 
clone),
<A HREF="https://www.sdrplay.com/support/open.php">open a ticket</A>
at the SDRplay website. OpenWebRX developers <B>cannot</B> help you 
with SDRplay hardware issues.
</P>

<A NAME="FAQ-REQUESTS"><H3>Can you implement a feature I want?</H3></A>
<P>
In general, <B>no</B>. OpenWebRX is a non-profit project, developed by 
very few people in their spare time. These developers will prioritize 
features they find personally interesting, repeatedly requested by a 
lot of people, or easy to implement.
</P>
<P>
Having said that, there is high probability that the feature you want is 
either already implemented, or can be achieved by some other means, or 
has been considered and avoided for some reason. Please, carefully read 
this document, especially the <A HREF="#FAQ">FAQ section</A>.
</P>
<P>
Also, since OpenWebRX is an open-source project, <B>nothing prevents you 
from adding features you want on your own</B>. Take a look at the
<A HREF="https://github.com/jketterl/openwebrx">original OpenWebRX source code</A>
or the
<A HREF="https://github.com/luarvique/openwebrx">OpenWebRX+ source code</A>
and consider participating in the OpenWebRX development.
</P>

<A NAME="FAQ-PROFILES"><H3>How do I hide some profiles from users?</H3></A>
<P>
Since OpenWebRX is an <B>open</B> online receiver, it <B>does not</B> 
let you hide profiles from the public. If you would like to have private 
access to your receiver, the best option is to make it inaccessible from 
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Having said that, there is an option to prevent users from changing 
profiles on a specific SDR device connected to OpenWebRX+. It comes 
useful if this SDR device performs background decoding and changes 
profiles based on its own schedule. To enable this option, do the 
following:
</P>
<OL>
<LI><P>
Go to <I>"Settings | General Settings | Receiver Limits | Magic Key"</I> 
and set the magic key value you would like to use to <B>force</B> 
switching profiles on a protected device.
</P>
<LI><P>
Go to <I>"Settings | SDR Devices and Profiles | &lt;Device&gt;"</I>, 
select <I>"Require magic key to switch profiles on this device"</I> from 
the <I>"Additional Optional Settings"</I> and click on <SPAN 
CLASS="Button">Add</SPAN>.
</P>
<LI><P>
Make sure the <I>"Require magic key to switch profiles on this 
device"</I> checkbox is checked, then click on <SPAN 
CLASS="Button">Apply and Save</SPAN>.
</P>
</OL>
<P>
From now on, users can only change profiles on the device by providing 
the preconfigured magic key value in the URL, as follows:
</P>
<PRE>http://openwebrx.receiver.org:8073/#<B>key=&lt;magic-key&gt;</B></PRE>

<A NAME="FAQ-JUMP-ANY"><H3>How do I jump to any frequency?</H3></A>
<P>
Since OpenWebRX works in terms of "profiles", i.e. preconfigured ranges 
of frequencies, you <B>cannot</B> jump to an arbitrary frequency because 
that new frequency may require different profile settings. Also, other 
users listening to the same profile may not appreciate you jumping to a 
completely new frequency.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, OpenWebRX+ does offer a way to "side-step" the current 
profile, going to adjacent frequencies. In order to enable 
side-stepping, do the following:
</P>
<OL>
<LI><P>
Go to <I>"Settings | General Settings | Receiver Limits"</I> and make 
sure the <I>"Allow users to change center frequency"</I> checkbox is 
checked.
</P>
<LI><P>
If you would like to protect frequency changes with a magic key, enter 
it in the adjacent <I>"Magic Key"</I> field.
</P>
<LI><P>
Click on <SPAN CLASS="Button">Apply and Save</SPAN> to save changes.
</P>
</OL>
<P>
From now on, you can step outside the preconfigured frequency range by 
right-clicking the large round arrows at the top of the receiver web 
page. Mobile users, who do not have a mouse, can simply hold these large 
round arrows with their finger for about a second.
</P>
<P>
If a magic key is configured, you will only be able to side-step 
profiles when providing that key in the URL, as follows:
</P>
<PRE>http://openwebrx.receiver.org:8073/#<B>key=&lt;magic-key&gt;</B></PRE>

<A NAME="FAQ-ENTER-ANY"><H3>How do I enter any frequency?</H3></A>
<P>
Due to the way OpenWebRX operates, you <B>cannot</B> just enter any 
frequency into the input field and expect it to work. The entered 
frequency must be within the current profile to work. Please,
<A HREF="#FAQ-JUMP-ANY">see above</A> for the reasons.
</P>
<P>
For a special case where you have <A HREF="#FAQ-JUMP-ANY">allowed</A>
OpenWebRX+ to step outside the preconfigured frequency range, entering
an arbitrary frequency can be enabled with a
<A HREF="#HOW-PLUGINS">JavaScript plugin</A>.
</P>

<A NAME="FAQ-CONFIG"><H3>Where are OpenWebRX configuration files?</H3></A>
<P>
If you wish to backup OpenWebRX configuration files, they are located as 
follows:
</P>
<PRE>
/var/lib/openwebrx/settings.json
/var/lib/openwebrx/bookmarks.json
/var/lib/openwebrx/users.json
/etc/openwebrx/openwebrx.conf
/etc/openwebrx/bands.json
/etc/openwebrx/bands-r1.json
/etc/openwebrx/bands-r2.json
/etc/openwebrx/bands-r3.json
</PRE>
<P>
You should <B>avoid editing configuration files by hand</B>, since they 
are normally modified via web-based settings interface. If you do decide 
to edit configuration files, always <B>make sure you have backup 
copies</B> first. After updating configuration files, restart OpenWebRX 
with:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">sudo systemctl restart openwebrx</PRE>

<A NAME="FAQ-HTTPS"><H3>How do I make OpenWebRX use HTTPS protocol?</H3></A>
<P>
While the original OpenWebRX version does not support HTTPS protocol, 
OpenWebRX+ does. In order to enable HTTPS in OpenWebRX+, <B>you will 
need the SSL certificate file (<I>cert.pem</I>) and the key for it 
(<I>key.pem</I>)</B>. Once you have these two files, do the following:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo cp &lt;cert.pem&gt; /etc/openwebrx/cert.pem
sudo cp &lt;key.pem&gt; /etc/openwebrx/key.pem
sudo chown openwebrx:openwebrx /etc/openwebrx/cert.pem
sudo chown openwebrx:openwebrx /etc/openwebrx/key.pem
sudo chmod 660 /etc/openwebrx/cert.pem
sudo chmod 660 /etc/openwebrx/key.pem
sudo systemctl restart openwebrx
</PRE>

<A NAME="FAQ-BOOKMARKS"><H3>How do I get rid of default yellow bookmarks?</H3></A>
<P>
OpenWebRX+ comes with predefined bookmarks for some common frequencies, 
such as weather information, CB channels, and so on. If you do not like 
to see these bookmarks, delete them and restart OpenWebRX+ as follows:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">
sudo rm -f /etc/openwebrx/bookmarks.d/*
sudo systemctl restart openwebrx
</PRE>
<P>
If you only want to get rid of <B>some</B> bookmarks, delete or edit 
individual files in the <I>/etc/openwebrx/bookmarks.d</I> folder.
</P>

<A NAME="FAQ-TEMPERATURE"><H3>My CPU temperature is wrong!</H3></A>
<P>
By default, OpenWebRX+ tries to determine the correct temperature sensor 
automatically. This works 99% of the time, but the remaining 1% may see
their temperatures way outside the realistic range. To tell OpenWebRX+
which sensor to use, edit the following file:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">sudo nano /etc/openwebrx/openwebrx.conf</PRE>
<P>
adding the following line to the <I>[core]</I> section:
</P>
<PRE>
[core]
temperature_sensor=<B>&lt;full-path-to-your-temperature-sensor&gt;</B>
</PRE>
<P>
Then save the edited file and restart OpenWebRX+.
</P>

<A NAME="FAQ-BANDPLAN"><H3>Band ribbons or green bookmarks are wrong!</H3></A>
<P>
By default, OpenWebRX+ is configured to use a combined band plan that 
mostly applies to all three regions of the ITU world. If you would like 
to use a region-specific band plan instead, go to <I>"Settings | General
| Receiver Information | Receiver Band Plan"</I> and select your region 
there. If you are still unhappy with the band plan or locations of the 
green bookmarks, you can change the default (combined) band plan by 
editing the following file:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">sudo nano /etc/openwebrx/bands.json</PRE>
<P>
There are also region-specific band plan files in the same folder. Prior 
to editing a file, make sure you <B>create a backup copy</B>, in case 
something goes wrong. After editing and saving a band plan file, restart 
OpenWebRX as follows:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="Shell">sudo systemctl restart openwebrx</PRE>
